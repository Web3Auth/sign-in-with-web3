With Sign-in With Web3, users will be able to take control of their digital identities with their Web3 accounts rather than relying on custodial Oauth
providers such as Google and Facebook. What this means is that users don't need to share their information and usage data. Leveraging the security and
privacy aspects of Web3 accounts, users can controls what they share and in what capacity with the apps/dApps they're interating with.

## Sign-in With Web3 - You Own Your Identity

One of the critical problems that web3 solves is privacy. Having control over the private key allows users to own their digital identities. Sign In
With Web3 leverages this very principle to allow any application (Web2 or Web3) to authenticate users with their Web3 address. Users simply need to
sign a message using any Web3 compatible wallet to do this.

## What does Sign-in With Web3 Solve?

Today most authentication mechanisms rely on accounts controlled by centralized identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and Apple. Identity
providers have complete control over the existence and use of usersâ€™ digital identities and data.

Sign-In with Web3 allows off-chain authentication of Web3 accounts by signing a standard message format parameterized by scope, session details, and
security mechanisms (e.g., a nonce) compliant with [CAIP-74](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md) which is the current
chain agnostic standard.

## Supported Chains

Currently Sign-in with Web3 supports

1. Ethereum
2. Solana
3. Starknet

\*\*Support for more chains coming soon.
